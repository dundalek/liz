# Liz: "Lispy" Zig programming language

**Status:** *Work in progress and highly experimental.*

- When you need a language closer to the metal and Clojure with GraalVM's native image is still too much overhead.
- [Type-A](https://github.com/dundalek/awesome-lisp-languages#classification) lisp-flavored language
- Written as Clojure-looking s-expressions and translated down to Zig code.
